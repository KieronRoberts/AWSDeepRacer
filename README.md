## Overview

AWS DeepRacer is a fully autonomous 1/18th scale race car driven by reinforcement learning. It consists of the following components:

- AWS DeepRacer console: An AWS Machine Learning service for training and evaluating reinforcement learning models in a three-dimensional simulated autonomous-driving environment.

- AWS DeepRacer vehicle: A 1/18th scale RC car capable of running inference on a trained AWS DeepRacer model for autonomous driving.

I am a Junior Software developer working mainly with Mircosoft PowerPlatforms, this repository is part of a larger portfolio I am developing as part of my personal education whilst transtioning from low-code development.

## Skills Learned

At the event where I developed this code, I learnt how to:

- Define reinforcement learning (RL) and distinguish it from supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
- Describe the main components of an RL model, including the agent, action, environment, state, and reward.
- Map the components of an RL model to AWS DeepRacer.
- Enter my own optimised RL model into a virtual and physical circuit of the AWS DeepRacer League.
